For setting up my Development environment I followed these exact step and I didn't encounter any challenges.
However, unfortunately I couldn't update my PC to windows 11, because according to Microsoft PC Health Check my PC
doesn't meet all the requirements for windows 11, my PC processor being the main reason.
